# EC2 Dynamic Sync Watch Mode Diagnostic Summary

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Status: RESOLVED

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixed

**Issue**: `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'` in watch mode
**Location**: `src/ec2_dynamic_sync/cli/watch.py`, line 107
**Root Cause**: Incorrect assumption that `path_obj.parts` returns Path objects (it returns strings)
**Fix Applied**: Changed `part.name.startswith(".")` to `part.startswith(".")`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED and tested

## 📋 Comprehensive Diagnostic Results

### ✅ Configuration Analysis
- **Config File**: `/Users/tejas/.ec2-sync.yaml` - Valid
- **Project**: `lightsheet`
- **Instance ID**: `i-0fb8bda5a4d0df591`
- **Directory Mapping**: `/Users/tejas/LightSheetFiles` - Exists and readable
- **Files Present**: 8 items including large `.czi` files (141MB-401MB each)
- **File Types**: `.czi` files are correctly allowed (not ignored)

### ✅ Watch Mode Components Verified
1. **Configuration Loading**: Working correctly
2. **Directory Watching Setup**: Successfully watching target directory
3. **File System Event Detection**: Detecting events properly (2 events per file creation)
4. **Path Matching Logic**: Correctly matching files to directory mappings
5. **Ignore Pattern Logic**: Working correctly after bug fix

### ✅ Event Detection Test Results
- **Test File Creation**: ✅ 2 events detected
- **File Processing**: ✅ Events properly routed to sync handler
- **Ignore Patterns**: ✅ Working correctly
  - `.DS_Store` → ❌ IGNORED (expected)
  - `.czi` files → ✅ ALLOWED
  - Test files → ✅ ALLOWED

## 🔍 Potential Remaining Issues

Since the core watch mode functionality is now working, if events are still not being triggered, the issue is likely:

### 1. **File Upload Method**
Some upload methods don't trigger filesystem events:
- Network file transfers (SMB, NFS)
- Cloud sync services (Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Atomic file moves from temp locations
- `rsync` with certain flags

### 2. **Timing Issues**
- **Min Interval**: 30-second minimum between syncs (default)
- **Delay**: 5-second delay after detecting changes (default)
- **Large Files**: `.czi` files (141MB-401MB) may take time to fully write

### 3. **Sync Execution Issues**
Events might be detected but sync might fail due to:
- SSH connectivity issues
- Large file transfer problems
- Network timeouts

Comprehensive diagnostic script testing all watch mode components

### 2. **debug_user_config.py**
User-specific diagnostic using actual configuration

### 3. **live_monitor.py**
Real-time event monitoring with verbose logging

### 4. **TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md**

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the fix**: Run `ec2-sync-watch` and try adding files
2. **Use live monitor**: Run `python live_monitor.py` to see real-time events
3. **Test different upload methods**: Try direct file creation vs. copying

### If Issues Persist
1. **Run live monitor** while uploading files to see if events are detected
2. **Check sync execution** separately with `ec2-sync sync --dry-run`
3. **Test with smaller files** to isolate large file issues
4. **Verify SSH connectivity** with `ec2-sync status`

### Optimization Settings
For faster response during testing:
```bash
ec2-sync-watch --delay 1 --min-interval 5 --batch-size 1
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Configuration | ✅ Working | Valid config, directory exists |
| File Watching | ✅ Working | Successfully watching target directory |
| Event Detection | ✅ Working | 2 events detected per file creation |
| Ignore Patterns | ✅ Working | Correctly filtering files |
| Path Matching | ✅ Working | Files matched to correct mapping |
| Bug Fix | ✅ Applied | `should_ignore()` method fixed |
| Tests | ✅ Passing | All 19 tests pass |

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **src/ec2_dynamic_sync/cli/watch.py**
   - Fixed line 107: `part.name.startswith(".")` → `part.startswith(".")`
   - Bug prevented watch mode from working at all

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **The watch mode was completely broken** due to the `should_ignore()` bug
2. **After the fix, all core functionality works correctly**
3. **Large .czi files are properly allowed** by ignore patterns
4. **Event detection is working** (confirmed with test files)
5. **If events still aren't triggering**, the issue is likely with:
   - File upload method not generating filesystem events
   - Sync execution failing (not event detection)
   - Timing/configuration issues

## 🚀 Success Criteria

The watch mode should now:
- ✅ Start without crashing
- ✅ Detect file creation/modification events
- ✅ Show proper instance ID (not "Unknown")
- ✅ Process .czi and other allowed file types
- ✅ Ignore system files (.DS_Store, etc.)

If the user is still experiencing issues, they should use the live monitor tool to determine if the problem is with event detection or sync execution.
